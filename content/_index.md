# Beluga Gaming

This is the home of [The Beluga](https://thebeluga.pro) <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, designed for frontend developers. It has two features:

1. [Social Feeds](/social/) See the latest commentary, content, and breakdowns.
2. [Modular CSS](/modular/) frontend workflow, makes design & developing a theme much easier.

We want Indiego to simplify the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), so that content creators can focus on [Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). This means **easily** syndicating your web site content to your social media networks.

## Getting started

To get started, deploy the absolutely minimal [Indiego starter kit](https://starter.indiego.org.uk/) by clicking this button here:
